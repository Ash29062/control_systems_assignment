## Report: Improving System Stability with Tachometer Feedback

### Objective
This report focuses on improving the stability of a control system by adding tachometer feedback. The original system has a damping ratio of 0.158, which causes oscillations and slower response. The goal is to increase the damping ratio to 0.5 using tachometer feedback and analyze the system’s performance.

### System Overview
- **Original System**:
  - Open-loop transfer function: $$ G(s) = \frac{10}{s(s+1)} $$
  - Damping ratio: 0.158 (low damping → more oscillations).
  - Natural frequency: 3.16 rad/s.

- **Modified System**:
  - Tachometer feedback added with gain $$ K_h = 2.16 $$.
  - New damping ratio: 0.5 (better stability).

### Results from MATLAB Simulink

#### Step Response
- **Original System**:
  - Shows large oscillations and overshoot.
  - Takes a long time to settle (slow response).
  
- **Modified System (with Tachometer Feedback)**:
  - Oscillations are reduced significantly.
  - Settling time is much faster.
  - Overshoot is minimal, showing improved stability.

#### Ramp Response (Error vs Time)
- **Original System**:
  - High steady-state error for ramp input (poor tracking).
  - Error decreases slowly over time.

- **Modified System (with Tachometer Feedback)**:
  - Steady-state error is much smaller (better tracking).
  - Error reduces quickly, reflecting improved performance.

### Key Observations
1. Adding tachometer feedback improves the system’s damping ratio, making it more stable.
2. The modified system responds faster, with fewer oscillations and less overshoot.
3. Tracking performance improves significantly, with reduced error for ramp inputs.
4. Overall, the system becomes more reliable and efficient after adding tachometer feedback.

### Conclusion
By introducing tachometer feedback with a gain of $$ K_h = 2.16 $$, the control system becomes more stable and responsive. The simulations clearly show that this modification reduces oscillations, speeds up settling time, and improves tracking accuracy for ramp inputs. This simple adjustment makes the system perform much better in both transient and steady-state conditions.
